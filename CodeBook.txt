Code Book for run_analysis.R

1. Information about the variables in the data set not contained in 
the run_analysis.R output (tidy_data.txt).  The description of the 
input variables used and not used by run_analysis.R can be found in
the UCI HAR Dataset directory.  Specifically, the files "features.txt"
and "features_info.txt"

2. Information about the summary choices made:  
The approach to constructing the tidy data set was to first combine
the test and training data of all subjects into one dataset.  The activity
and subject information had to be combined as well.  
- One key assumption was that the activity and subject information files 
were listed in the same order as the test and train data sets.

- The tidy data set only used the mean and standard deviation measurements
from the raw test and training sets. This would be any variables
from the raw data set that contained the strings "mean(), std(), and
meanFreq()".

- The tidy data set then is result of grouping these variables by subject
and activity and taking the average of those measurements.
