# run_analysis.R
This script is submitted for the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data.

1. RAW DATA INPUT: 

run_analysis.R must have the directory "UCI HAR Dataset" in the
working directory.  This directory has the dataset:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset v1.0
Reference: [1] Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012


2. DATA OUTPUT: run_analysis.R will write a file called "tidy_data.txt"
to the working directory.  tidy_data.txt contains the average of the mean
and standard deviation of measurements for each activity and each subject.
